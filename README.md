# Shagu Addons

## Moving Forward

My active involvement in addon development has come to an end. I no longer find the Turtle-WoW community a nice place to be, and other Vanilla and Burning Crusade servers now support the latest game clients that donâ€™t require my addons. The few remaining people who value my contributions are not enough to justify dedicating such large amounts of my personal time into this.

The enjoyment of the game has decreased over time. As a result, I will be reducing my activity and will not provide updates as often as before.
While I may occasionally be online and address bugs as they arise, please do not expect the same level of activity or support as in the past.
I will continue to review and process well-crafted pull requests, as long as they are thoroughly tested and not the result of automated or unverified AI-generated content.
